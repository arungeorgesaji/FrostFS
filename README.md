# FrostFS

A filesystem where unused files slowly “freeze” over time.
Frozen files take longer to access, and extremely frozen files become read-only until "thawed."

## Advanced Features

- Ice Crystals - File fragmentation over time 
- Frost Patterns - Visual representation of file states 
- Seasonal Thawing - Automatic batch thawing cycles
- Freezing Algorithms - Different freezing strategies 
- Antifreeze - Files that resist freezing 
- Glacier Storage - Deep archival with recovery costs 
- Thermal Imaging - Heat maps of file activity
- Freeze Propagation - Directory-level freezing
